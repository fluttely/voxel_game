/// voxel_core's chunks drawn with flutter_scene: the [ChunkMeshSink] a
/// [ChunkStreamer] hands finished meshes to. Chunks are drawn in regions of
/// [regionChunks] × [regionChunks]: one [Node] per region under [root], one
/// child per non-empty surface on its material. The three lit surfaces draw in
/// [TerrainGeometry]'s 16-byte packed vertex; the glow in the engine's own, its
/// light in the second UV set.
///
/// A region is one draw per surface where a chunk was one each, because
/// flutter_scene batches only draws of the identical geometry. The price is
/// that a chunk's mesh or removal rebuilds its region's geometry from the
/// surfaces of its chunks, which the view keeps: the lit ones packed the first
/// time a rebuild reads them, so a later rebuild moves words and never packs
/// again.
///
/// [apply] and [remove] only mark a region to rebuild; [rebuild], once a frame,
/// builds them within a time budget, so the chunks a streamer hands over
/// together are drawn over a few frames instead of in one long one, and a
/// region is built once however many of its chunks changed. Nothing is drawn
/// before [rebuild] runs.
///
/// [cull] hides the regions sight cannot reach from the camera through open
/// cells, by the [ChunkVisibility] each chunk's mesh carries
/// ([SectionOcclusion]). A hidden region's surfaces take [Node.layers] 0: the
/// colour and depth passes skip them, while they still cast into the shadow
/// map and leave its static cache alone, so a hill hidden behind the camera
/// still shades what is in view.
///
/// Regions come in two sizes: the [regionChunks] ones the view builds, and the
/// [settledRegionChunks] ones a quiet area settles into, one draw per surface
/// where its smaller regions drew several. A settled region is drawn either as
/// itself or as its [regionChunks] quadrants, never both and never neither:
///
/// * **It settles** once every one of its chunks has a mesh, none came,
///   changed or left for [settleAfter], none of its quadrants waits for
///   [rebuild], and none of its chunks lies within [settleClear] chunks of the
///   `near` that [rebuild] is given. Settling is optional work: it runs in
///   [rebuild] after the quadrants, in steps (copy a chunk, upload a part,
///   swap), each only when its predicted cost fits what the quadrants left of
///   the budget, never as a frame's forced first build, one settled region at
///   a time. Each lit surface draws in parts of at most
///   [PackedSurface.maxPartVertices] vertices, so a part uploads within the
///   budget and keeps 16-bit indices.
/// * **It splits** when one of its chunks comes, changes or leaves, or when it
///   comes within [settleClear] of `near`: its quadrants are rebuilt as any
///   region is, while it stays drawn, and replace it in the [rebuild] that has
///   built the last of them.
///
